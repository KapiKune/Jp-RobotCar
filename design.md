This document can be brief, but should illustrate your plan for how you will solve the main and optional objectives of the challenge. Include the following sections:

#Introduction 
(2-3 sentences) - explain the problem in your own words, and the intended solution in simplistic terms that a someone without a technical background can easily understand.

#Design 
(At least a paragraph) - describe how you will solve the problem outlined in section 1. Include a description of the robot car and its sensors (diagrams are cool too!). Be sure to acknowledge any additional sensors or other hardware additions you plan to add. Circuit diagrams also go here if you plan to do any wiring.

Consider a UML diagram in this section to illustrate all of the different components of the robot and how they will communicate.

3. Implementation (At least a paragraph) - here you will dive into specific details pertaining to the program itself. Here are some things to consider:
What programming language will you use? (hint: Python)
What data structures, algorithms, etc will you use?
What packages / libraries will you use? (e.g. random, time, OpenCV, etc)
Will your code be organized into a class, separate classes in multiple files, etc?
Define a list of functions you think you will need and describe their inputs (parameters) and outputs (return values)
